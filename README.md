### 3️⃣ Fire Detection System 🔥📷
**Description:** A state-of-the-art AI-powered fire detection system that integrates with standard surveillance cameras. This system utilizes deep learning techniques to detect the presence of fire in real-time, sending instant alerts to users and relevant authorities to prevent fire-related disasters before they escalate.

**Implementation:**
Powered by YOLOv8, a cutting-edge object detection model, the system processes live video feeds to identify fire patterns with high accuracy. It operates continuously, analyzing frame-by-frame data and triggering alerts whenever a fire is detected. The system is lightweight and can run on edge devices, reducing dependency on cloud processing.
